Hi, Thanks for using these assets.

They are free to use however you like personally, commercially etc with the exception of reselling as part of a pack online or otherwise.

I have provided them in OBJ and FBX format along with color and normal maps in JPG format.

I'd really appreciate you making a comment, sharing the page you found them on or supporting me in some other way (like a retweet/website link) if possible ;-) 

Credits or a website link are appreciated but not essential.

Thanks,
